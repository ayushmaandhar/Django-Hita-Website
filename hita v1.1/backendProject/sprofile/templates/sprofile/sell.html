            According to section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, sale of transfer refers to “the ownership in exchange for a price paid or promised or part-paid and part-promised. Basically, in a sale there exists an absolute transfer of all rights in the property sold”. 
            Sale agreement is one of the most powerful documents in the transaction as it has legal value and can be produced as evidence. The agreement between the buyer and seller is the document in which the sale deed is drafted. Every document acting as evidence of transfer of property by sale is preceded by an agreement to sell. It spells out in clear-cut terms the conditions under which the seller intends to sell the property and the buyer intends to purchase it. Seller also needs to have a copy of the approved building plan and occupation certificate issued by the competent authority. The sanctioned plan highlights the area covered, build-up area and the open area of the property. It is a detailed outline plan of the property sanctioned by the appropriate authority. The original conveyance or sale deed from the previous owners of the property is required when the seller is selling a property. In case seller have lodged the original deed for registration with the Registrar, seller needs to provide a copy of the conveyance deed or sale deed along with a photocopy of the receipt from the Sub-registrar where the documents have been lodged for registration. Sale deed is important as it traces the ownership of the property. It is necessary to prove the chain of previous agreements with past owners.
            The seller has the right to Lien or charges on the property if any amount is unpaid by the seller. According to Section 55(4) (b) if the price remains unpaid, the seller cannot refuse delivery of possession for or can claim back the possession if already given to the buyer, but he (seller) is given a right to recover unpaid purchase money from and out of the property. Now, we come to the most vital stage of documentation. Of late, there has been an increase in the number of property-related disputes that are a direct outcome of insufficient or improper documentation. It is therefore pertinent that both the buyer and the seller give due consideration to the documentation of the deal. These documents will be scrutinized by potential buyers. The buyers often insist on checking the original documents even before finalizing the deal.
